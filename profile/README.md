### SQUASH YOUR VIDEO FILES

Is your device running out of storage because of large video files? Feeling stressed every time you open other video compression apps and presented with words like bitrate, resolution and fps? Making no progress in reducing file sizes or freeing up space?

Let Squashet handle it for you. Squashet is the fun and fast way to free up storage and bring joy to anyone that receives your perfectly compressed videos. Squash your videos quickly and easily, freeing up storage and maintaining quality. 
Say goodbye to bulky videos taking up space on your camera roll and wasting data sending large videos to others.
Say hello to the most optimised camera roll of your life whilst keeping all your memories intact without losing quality.

#### âš¡ COMPRESS WITH A TAP
Choose as many videos as you'd like, tap squash, then watch the magic happen as your videos are optimised to take up the perfect amount of storage whilst retaining their quality.

#### ðŸ¤© QUALITY ALWAYS RETAINED
Squashet uses its own proprietary algorithm that reduces the file size of your video without loss of quality. Once you see for yourself you'll never send another large video again.

#### ðŸš€ SAVE AND SHARE INSTANTLY
After compressing your videos, send them to your friends, family and colleagues and watch their amazement at how small the videos are whilst maintaining their quality.

#### ðŸ“± SQUASH COMPLETELY OFFLINE
What's better than reducing the size of your videos? Being able to do it anywhere, even without internet access. Next time you're on a plane or the underground subway, take out Squashet and reduce that video size before AirDropping. 

#### ðŸ”’ 100% PRIVATE AND SECURE - YOUR VIDEOS NEVER LEAVE YOUR IPHONE
Squashet exists to help you reduce video size, not to collect your precious memories. Squashet works completely locally which means your videos never leave your device. Squashet never stores or uploads your videos anywhere.
